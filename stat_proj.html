<h1>This page embeds a PDF</h1>

<p>Shoutout to this website for its instructions on how to embed a PDF. This stack overflow page seemed to have some doubts about whether this will work on all browsers, but let's go with it for now.</p>

<p>The PDF I've embedded is my group's project from API 201Z last semester. It looks at Boston's schools's performance and demographics, as compared to their neighborhoods' demographics.</p>
