<h1>This page embeds a PDF</h1>

<p>Shoutout to <a href="https://www.codexworld.com/embed-pdf-document-file-in-html-web-page/">this website</a> for its instructions on how to embed a PDF. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/291813/recommended-way-to-embed-pdf-in-html">This stack overflow page</a> seemed to have some doubts about whether this will work on all browsers, but let's go with it for now.</p>

<p>The PDF I've embedded is my group's project from API 201Z last semester. It looks at Boston's schools's performance and demographics, as compared to their neighborhoods' demographics.</p>
