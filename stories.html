<h1><em>The Adventures of John Watson</em></h1>

<p>Poor Watson has been put down long enough. I used python to swap the names of the two protagonists in <em>The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes</em> so that John Watson finally gets to be the hero. The version on the left below is the original. On the right is the corrected version. </p>

<p>A few side characters named John in the original have been renamed Sherlock in the new edition as a side effect of the switch.</p>

<p>I used the ASCII version of the stories (which are in the public domain) from <a href="https://sherlock-holm.es/stories/plain-text/advs.txt">this site</a>.</p>
